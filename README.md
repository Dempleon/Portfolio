# Portfolio
This project is the first page of my Portfolio. As I continue with the bootcamp, I will continue to add more deatiails, as well as any necessary edits.

## Project Description
This webpage is my Portfolio. There are three sections which include an about me, a previous work section, and a contact section. When clicking on a link in the top nav bar, it scrolls down to the corresponding section. Each section header is a sticky at the top of the page. The work section content is flexible and resizes dynamically depending on the size. It showcases some computer programing projects that I have worked on in the past.
